        <article>About Me</article>
        <p> Hello! My name is Mary Maloney. I grew up the oldest of nine children, all girls save one boy. I jokingly consider myself their second mother since I did my fair share of child rearing. Before attending Algonquin College for the Interactive Media Design program, I went to the University of Ottawa for Film Studies and English Literature. I used my extra credits on any music class I could get into, though I do not have any musical abilities to boast. I have <abbr title="Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder">ADHD</abbr> and I’ve always prioritized following my interests rather than trying to find one set career.
            <br> 
            I <em> love</em> everything that flexes my creative muscles, drawing, dancing, and video editing are some examples. I definitely can be described as a jack of all trades, but a master of none. In addition, I love reading and outdoor activities like hiking. A fun fact about me is I would rather have salt and vinegar chips than a dessert any day. Unless it is tiramisu, which I eat a lot of because I serve part time at an Italian restaurant (which I also love).
            <br>
